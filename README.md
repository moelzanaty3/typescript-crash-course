# Typescript Crash Course
the needed skills you need to ship to get familiar with typescript 

## TypeScript Setup

you can open your terminal and install typescript globally in your machine via 
```shell
npm install -g typescript
```
and you will be able to find it's version via `tsc --version` but as mention in [official website for 
typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download) 

> Having TypeScript set up on a per-project basis lets you have many projects with many different versions of TypeScript, this keeps each project working consistently.

so now we will install it via npm TypeScript is available as a [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) on the npm registry available as `typescript`.

You will need a copy of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as an environment to run the package. Then you use a dependency manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to download TypeScript into your project.

```shell
npm install typescript --save-dev
# or 
yarn add typescript --dev
```
